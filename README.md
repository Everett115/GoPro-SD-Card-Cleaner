# GoPro-SD-Card-Cleaner
Batch file that removes all .THM and .LRV files from the SD card.
These files are just used for perviews in the GoPro mobile app and when you are importing lots of footage they can slow things down.  

Just open this batch file and input the drive letter of your SD card and press enter. It will ask if you are sure you want to delete and you can insert y for yes
